A simple Network with Distributed Hash Table

## How to Run

I use `C` implement the code. You need to use  command `make`  to generate the execution code `p2p`. 

File `Setup.sh` is a script file, and emits 7 xterms at a time for code execution----all are with parameter `init`. Optionally ---- it is annoted by default----I also add an implementation with parameters of 6 `init` and 1`join`.  Note that all are using 20 `ping interval`.
